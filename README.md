# Project ideas that I have include:
- Using PokeAPI to create a web app that allows users to look up any information on Pokemon instantly.
  - Can create a more complex project with the data like PokeDoku or Showdown
- Create a text editor like Google Docs where users can create, edit, and collabrate with other users in real time.
